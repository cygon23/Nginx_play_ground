# Load Balancer with NGINX, Docker, and Node.js (Express)

This project demonstrates the use of NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple Node.js (Express) containers running in Docker. It also demonstrates setting up self-signed SSL certificates for secure HTTPS communication on port 443.

## Features

- Load balancing across multiple replicas of a static webpage served by Node.js.
- NGINX configured as a reverse proxy and load balancer to distribute incoming traffic evenly.
- Self-signed SSL certificates to run the application over HTTPS (port 443).
- Docker Compose used to manage the multi-container setup.

## Project Structure

The project uses the following components:

1. **NGINX**: Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
2. **Node.js (Express)**: Serves a static webpage with a simple backend.
3. **Docker**: Used to create and manage containers for NGINX and the Node.js application.
4. **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates the multi-container Docker application.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node,Ngix, and docker
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (including Docker Compose)
- Basic understanding of NGINX, Docker, and Node.js (Express)

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git https://github.com/cygon23/Nginx_play_ground
cd  Nginx_play_ground
```

### Step 2: Build and Start the Containers

1. **Self-Signed Certificates**: The project uses self-signed SSL certificates for HTTPS. If you donâ€™t have them, you can create them using the following command:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout ssl/server.key -x509 -out ssl/server.crt -days 365 OR
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 356 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout name.key -out name.crt
```

2. **Build and Start the Docker Containers**:

Run Docker Compose to build and start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will:

- Build the Docker images for the Node.js application and NGINX reverse proxy.
- Create and run 3 replicas of the Node.js application.
- Set up NGINX as the reverse proxy and load balancer.

### Step 3: Access the Application

1. Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost`. You should see the static webpage served by the Node.js application, and the traffic will be load-balanced across the three replicas.
2. Since the certificates are self-signed, you may need to accept the security warning in your browser.

### Step 4: View the Logs

You can check the logs of the containers to ensure everything is running properly:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

This will show the logs of all the services (NGINX and Node.js).

### Step 5: Scaling the Application (Optional)

You can easily scale the Node.js replicas by updating the `docker-compose.yml` file and changing the number of replicas for the `node-app` service. For example, change this section:

```yaml
services:
  node-app:
    build: ./node-app
    deploy:
      replicas: 3 # You can change this value to scale the app
```

After making the change, restart the services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 6: Stopping the Application

To stop the running containers, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes created by `docker-compose down`.

## Configuration Details

### NGINX Configuration

The NGINX configuration (`nginx.conf`) is set up to:

- Proxy HTTPS traffic to the Node.js application.
- Load balance requests across the 3 Node.js replicas.
- Use SSL certificates for secure communication.

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name localhost;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://node-app;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

upstream node-app {
    server node-app:3000;
    server node-app:3001;
    server node-app:3002;
}
```

### Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services for the application:

- **nginx**: The NGINX container acting as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
- **node-app**: The Node.js application container, which is replicated 3 times for load balancing.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl
    ports:
      - "443:443"

  node-app:
    build: ./node-app
    container_name: node-app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    networks:
      - app-network
    deploy:
      replicas: 3

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple example of using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer in a Dockerized environment with Node.js (Express). The setup allows you to scale the application, use SSL for secure communication, and distribute the traffic across multiple replicas of the Node.js app.
